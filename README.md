# Used Cars Price Prediction Application

### Machine Learning model deployment with Flask framework
### Objective:
1. To build a Machine learning regression model to predict the selling price of the used cars based on the different input features like fuel_type, kms_driven, type of transmission etc.
2. Deploy the machine learning model with the help of the flask framework.

### Dataset Information:
#### Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=CAR+DETAILS+FROM+CAR+DEKHO.csv

This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com
- **Car_Name**: Name of the car
- **Year**: Year of Purchase
- **Selling Price (target)**: Selling price of the car in lakhs
- **Present Price**: Present price of the car in lakhs
- **Kms_Driven**: kilometers driven
- **Fuel_Type**: Petrol/diesel/CNG
- **Seller_Type**: Dealer or Indiviual
- **Transmission**: Manual or Automatic
- **Owner**: first, second or third owner

### Learning Outcomes:

- **Understanding Regression**: Learn how to predict selling prices using regression algorithms.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split data for training and testing.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create and select relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- **Flask Deployment**: Deploy the model using Flask for web-based predictions.
- **Project Management**: Gain experience in project management and collaboration tools like Git.
- **Automotive Domain Knowledge**: Understand factors affecting car prices, like year, mileage, and fuel type.
